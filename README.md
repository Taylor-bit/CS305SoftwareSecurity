# CS-305 Software Security
## A repository for my work completed throughout my CS-305 Software Security course at Southern New Hampshire University

The client, Artemis Financial, is a fintech organization that required a repeatable method for identifying and mitigating third-party vulnerabilities as well as a secure-by-default web service. I added a targeted suppression file to filter out obvious false-positive CPE matches without obscuring real issues, and I redesigned the application to enforce HTTPS with a keystore to protect data in transit. I also integrated the OWASP Dependency-Check Maven plugin to enable vulnerability assessment in the build. These procedures serve as the foundation for the project that my report is built on.

Secure coding is important because it reduces breach risk, enhances compliance posture, and prevents vulnerable libraries from shipping. I did a good job of connecting findings to specific fixes and verification by enabling TLS, verifying the secure endpoint, supporting automated scanning, and maintaining the visibility of legitimate CVEs. Triaging Dependency-Check results and creating narrow suppressions was the most difficult and helpful part, as it improved my ability to distinguish between risk and noise. By integrating keystore-based secret handling, integrity checks (SHA-256), encrypted transport, and continuous dependency governance, I was able to increase layers of security; moving forward, I would add SAST/DAST and an SBOM to further guide mitigation decisions. I re-ran the scanner to make sure no new vulnerabilities were introduced and tested the service via HTTPS to make sure the app remained secure and functional after refactoring. Employers can review the report I completed, which includes the tools and techniques I'll utilize, such as the Dependency-Check plugin, suppression management, secure defaults in application.properties, and a defense-in-depth approach.
